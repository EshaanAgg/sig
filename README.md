## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- Uses `MaterialUI` and `Tailwind` for styling
- Uses `React Monaco Editor` to integrate live editing.
- Built in error handling with the help of `SIGMA`
- Supports multiple backends through `pySigma`
- Continuously updated to stay in sync with `pySigma`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
